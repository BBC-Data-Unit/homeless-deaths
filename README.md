In December 2018 we provided a regional breakdown for [a story on new figures from the Office for National Statistics on the number of deaths of homeless people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46613609).

Almost 600 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2017, according to the figures being published for the first time. 

The figure represented a rise of 24% over five years.
